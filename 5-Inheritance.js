// Inheritance:

/* 
    Inheritance is an important concept in Object Oriented Programming paradigm.
    Itâ€™s a process by which child objects inherit the properties of the parent object.
    In javascript, inheritance is built into objects and every object has a property called
    prototype which refers to the parent of that object and this chain goes up until the prototype points to null.
*/

// Parent Object
class Person{
    constructor(name){
        this.name = name;
    }
    sayName(){
        console.log(this.name);
    }
}

// Child Object
class Student extends Person{
    constructor(name, rollNumber){
        super(name);
        this.rollNumber = rollNumber;
    }
    logDetails(){
        console.log(`Name: ${this.name}, Roll number: ${this.rollNumber}`)
    }
}

var student = new Student("Heisenberg", 1);
student.logDetails();    // Name: Heisenberg, Roll number:1
student.sayName();       // Heisenberg

// Student class has access to all properties of the person class.
