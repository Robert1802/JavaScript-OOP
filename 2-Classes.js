// Classes

/*
    Classes are blueprint of an Object.
    A class can have many Objects because class is a template while Object are instances of the class or the concrete implementation. 
    Before we move further into implementation, we should know unlike other Object Oriented Language there are no classes in JavaScript we have only Object.
    To be more precise, JavaScript is a prototype based Object Oriented Language, which means it doesnâ€™t have classes,
    rather it defines behaviors using a constructor function and then reuse it using the prototype. 
    Even the classes provided by ECMA2015 are objects.
